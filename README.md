Windows scancode map tool
=========================

Goal is to use this to change scancode map easily.
There won't be no fancy interface, you'll have to provide
map in separate lua file -- `mapping.lua`.

Currently there are two scancode maps (us-1 and us-2).

Mostly this is just experiment with http://luajit.org

P.S. Don'f blame me if you'll end up with machine to which you can't log-in :P
